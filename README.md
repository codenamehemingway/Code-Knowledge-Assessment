# Code-Knowledge-Assessment

## AS A web developer

## I WANT to showcase my javascript knowledge with a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores,

## SO THAT you can gauge my capabilities compared to the candidates I am competing with.

### GIVEN you are taking a code quiz

### WHEN you click the start button

### THEN a timer starts and you are presented with a question

### WHEN you answer a question

### THEN you am presented with another question

### WHEN you answer a question incorrectly

### THEN time is subtracted from the clock

### WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

### THEN the game is over

### WHEN the game is over

### THEN you can save your initials and score
